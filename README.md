# Text_Similarity
Text similarity has to determine how 'close' two pieces of text are both in surface closeness **lexical similarity** and meaning **semantic similarity**. For instance, how similar are the phrases “the cat ate the mouse” with “the mouse ate the cat food” by just looking at the words?
